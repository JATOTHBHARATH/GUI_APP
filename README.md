# GUI_APP
I have created a GUI APP using python and python tkinter module.
This is an application in which users can add data to a csv file using form. This application is created using Tkinter and Python. 
It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
you can run the code and then a popup will appear on the window which is user friedly.
Now you can add and store data in a file.
for example I have stored four to five data in file.txt and file.csv.
